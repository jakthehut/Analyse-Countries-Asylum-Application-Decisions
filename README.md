# Asylum Application Outcome Analysis Tool
Part of final project for Data Science Project   
Central European University, Vienna  
## About the Tool

This tool is designed to perform a detailed statistical analysis of asylum applications across different countries, focusing on the correlation between accepted and rejected applications. It provides insights into country-specific trends, exploring whether decisions over time could be random or follow discernible patterns. This analysis includes a comprehensive approach to examining cumulative data at the country level, the rate of change in asylum application outcomes over time, and detailed case studies of specific countries.

## Features

- **Cumulative Analysis at the Country Level:** Generates scatter plots and performs linear regression to explore the relationship between the number of accepted and rejected asylum applications per country.

- **Global Trends and Rate of Change Analysis:** Analyzes the global rate of change in asylum application outcomes to identify broader trends.

- **Detailed Country-Level Rate of Change Analysis:** Offers a focused examination of individual countries to detect patterns in the correlation between rates of change in accepted and rejected applications.

- **Implications and Policy Insights:** Provides interpretations and potential policy implications based on the observed data trends, including visualizations for countries such as Canada, the USA, and Austria.

## How to Use
1. **Clone Repository** 
1. **Setup:** Ensure your environment has the necessary dependencies installed. This typically includes statistical analysis and data visualization libraries in Python.

2. **Data Preparation:** Input your asylum application data, ensuring it's formatted according to the tool's requirements. This usually involves having a dataset with columns for the country, year, number of accepted applications, and number of rejected applications.

3. **Running Analyses:**
    Follow the scripts in the notebook.
4. **Interpreting Results:** The tool generates various figures and statistical test outcomes to help interpret the correlations between accepted and rejected asylum applications. Pay close attention to p-values and correlation coefficients to understand the significance of the results.

5. **Exploring Implications:** Use the findings to explore implications and generate insights into potential asylum policy strategies or patterns, as demonstrated in the case studies included in the tool.
